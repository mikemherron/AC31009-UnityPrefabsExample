## AC31009 Week 9 - Reusable Componets - Unity Example
This the small sample project used in the Week 9 seminar on Reusable Componets. 

The `main` branch contains the base game. In the `with-prefabs` branch, Prefabs have been created for the turrets with a Prefab Variant created for large turrets. The Healthbar from the player has also been refactored in to a prefab, and a HealthController component extracted so that the Healthbar can also be used with the turrets. See the weekly seminar slides for the relevant diagrams.
